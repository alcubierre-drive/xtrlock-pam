[LoadBMP][LoadBMP] is a single-header C library
for loading and saving [BMP][BMP] image files.

[LoadBMP][LoadBMP] has no no dependencies besides the standard C libraries
`stdlib.h`, `string.h` and `stdio.h`.


## Examples

[LoadBMP][LoadBMP] uses raw buffers and support RGB (`LOADBMP_RGB`) and RGBA (`LOADBMP_RGBA`) formats.
The order is RGBRGBRGB... or RGBARGBARGBA..., from top left
to bottom right, without any padding.

The format ultimately only affects the size and layout of the pixel buffer.
Thereby when loading a BMP and selecting `LOADBMP_RGBA`, an alpha value of 255 is added.
When saving the BMP the knowledge of an alpha value is only used to be able
to skip it and properly index the colors.

### Loading BMP

```c
unsigned char *pixels = NULL;
unsigned int width, height;

unsigned int err = loadbmp_decode_file("image.bmp", &pixels, &width, &height, LOADBMP_RGBA);

if (err)
	printf("LoadBMP Load Error: %u\n", err);

// Remember to free the pixel data when it isn't needed anymore.
free(pixels);
```


### Saving BMP

```c
unsigned char *pixels = ...;
unsigned int width, height;

unsigned int err = loadbmp_encode_file("image.bmp", pixels, width, height, LOADBMP_RGBA);

if (err)
	printf("LoadBMP Load Error: %u\n", err);
```
